Project Summary: Predicting Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success
This capstone project focuses on predicting the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landings by SpaceX, aiming to analyze factors influencing landing outcomes and determine the associated costs of rocket launches. 
By accurately forecasting landing success, stakeholders can assess launch costs and competitiveness against other providers. The project is structured into four comprehensive modules, each with specific objectives and methodologies:

1. Introduction and Problem Definition
Overview:
Objective: Predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage to estimate launch costs, enabling competitors to bid effectively against SpaceX.
Context: SpaceX offers rocket launches at $62 million, significantly lower than competitors charging upwards of $165 million, primarily due to the reusability of the first stage.

Key Objectives:
Develop Python scripts for data manipulation using Pandas.
Convert JSON data into Pandas dataframes.
Create and share Jupyter notebooks via GitHub.
Apply data science methodologies to define and frame the business problem.
Load, clean, and extract insights from datasets using data analysis tools.

2.  Data Collection and Wrangling
Overview:
Objective: Gather data on Falcon 9 first-stage landings through RESTful APIs and web scraping, then transform the data for analysis.

Key Objectives:
Generate scatter plots and bar charts using Python for data analysis.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) by manipulating dataframes.
Execute SQL queries to select and organize data.
Utilize data visualization techniques to identify meaningful patterns that inform the modeling process.

3. Data Visualization and Dashboard Development
Overview:
Objective: Create interactive visualizations and dashboards to analyze launch records and launch site proximities.
Key Objectives:
Develop an interactive dashboard with pie charts and scatter plots using Plotly Dash.
Calculate and visualize distances on maps with the Folium library.
Generate interactive maps, plot coordinates, and identify clusters using Folium.
Analyze launch records interactively through Plotly Dash dashboards.
Assess launch site proximities using interactive Folium maps.

4. Machine Learning Model Building
Overview:
Objective: Employ machine learning techniques to predict the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings.

Key Objectives:
Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
Train various classification models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression.
Optimize hyperparameters using grid search techniques.
Evaluate and identify the best-performing model based on test data to enhance predictive accuracy and business efficiency.

Overall Goals and Impact
By the end of this project, participants will have developed a robust predictive model to forecast Falcon 9 first-stage landing successes. 
This model will aid in determining launch costs, providing valuable insights for SpaceX and its competitors. Additionally, the project emphasizes practical skills in data manipulation, visualization, dashboard creation, and machine learning, equipping participants with the tools necessary to tackle real-world business problems in the aerospace industry.
