Project Summary: Predicting Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success
This capstone project focuses on predicting the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landings by SpaceX, aiming to analyze factors influencing landing outcomes and determine the associated costs of rocket launches. 

Overall Goals and Impact
By the end of this project, participants will have developed a robust predictive model to forecast Falcon 9 first-stage landing successes. 
This model will aid in determining launch costs, providing valuable insights for SpaceX and its competitors. Additionally, the project emphasizes practical skills in data manipulation, visualization, dashboard creation, and machine learning, equipping participants with the tools necessary to tackle real-world business problems in the aerospace industry.
